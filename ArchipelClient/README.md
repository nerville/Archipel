# What is Archipel Client ?

Archipel Client is a pure javascript interface written in Cappuccino that allows
to control your several Archipel Agent. It gives you a neat interface to perform
all the tasks you need to manage your virtual platform. Not that it just needs to 
be placed in a HTTP served directory. It doesn't need php, java, mysql or anything
else than a decent HTML5 capable web browser.
